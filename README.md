# Decentralized Identity

- Long-standing centralized Intermediaries, like the Government or Big Companies, are the ones who make and keep the ID Information of their Customer
- This implies that the Customer have no Control over their Information relating to their Identification,
  - who has Access to personally identifiable Information, and
  - to what Extent
- Decentralized Identity provides identity-related Information that is self-controlled, private, and portable
- Decentralized Identity use decentralized Identifiers and Attestations as their Main Components

## Ceramic

- Ceramic is a public, permissionless, open-source Protocol that offers Computation, State Transitions, and Consensus for all Data Structures on the decentralized Web

- Ceramic provides a decentralized Application Database
- Developers can use the decentralized Application Database to reuse Data across Applications and automatically make them interoperable

- Ceramic is a public, decentralized, censorship-resistant Network for Managing mutable Information on the open Internet without Databases or Servers
- In Ceramic all Content is stored in Smart Documents, which are append-only IPFS Logs where each Commit is signed by a Decentralized Identifier for Verifiability and then subsequently anchored in a Blockchain for Consensus
- Ceramic is built on a Peer-to-Peer Network, therefore all Documents are openly discoverable and can be referenced by other Documents or queried by any other Participant on the Network

### Decentralized Identity

- Decentralized Identity is a digital Identification Concept where People, companies, and Items are in Charge of their Data and can share it selectively without relying on a centralized Authority
- Decentralized Identity gives People Control and Ownership over the Information associated with their Identities rather than having it stored on a central Server or managed by a third Party
- Decentralized Identity is a self-owned, independent Identity that enables trusted Data Exchange

### Decentralized Identifiers

- Decentralized Identifiers are issued, held, and controlled by Individuals
- Since Decentralized Identifiers are kept on a Peer-to-Peer Networks or Distributed Ledgers (Blockchains), they are globally unique, highly available, and cryptographically verifiable
- A Decentralized Identifier can be associated with an Individuals, a Group or a Governmental Entity

- Decentralized Identifiers are designed to offer a uniform Process for Developing, Maintaining, and Exchanging Digital Identities independent of any Company or Technology
- Decentralized Identifiers can be maintained and controlled by the Person or Entity to which it belongs and utilized across various Systems and Applications
